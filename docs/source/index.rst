Welcome to newbie-oogway's documentation!
===================================

**newbie-oogway** Our application leverages the advanced and flexible platforms of TurtleBot4 and OpenManipulatorX. 
Our aim is to unveil a groundbreaking prototype that encapsulates the core functionalities of navigation and exploration 
within indoor environments, akin to the esteemed capabilities of a Roomba robot. While it may not feature the conventional 
vacuum or mop head, it excels in other significant aspects, offering an enhanced user experience.

This prototype stands out by integrating an innovative featureâ€”a robotic arm designed to efficiently clear its path of 
obstacles. This addition addresses a common frustration among users of traditional cleaning robots: the struggle with 
clothing and other items that often impede their operation. By seamlessly blending the reliable movement and search 
capabilities of a Roomba with the precision and adaptability of the OpenManipulatorX.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
